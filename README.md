# Space Fire

Space Fire is a fixed screen shooter game with the aim that the player is a spacecraft, which is located in space, and to shoot the balls that appear on the screen and prevent them from hitting the spacecraft.
Once you shoot a ball it is reduced to a smaller ball for each shot taken, until you get to destroy it.
When an enemy is killed randomly, a "Life" bonus that adds a life to the counter of lives may come out, or a "Power" bonus that adds power to the power counter and adds a hit to the spacecraft, or a bonus "Slow" that activates a slow motion mode to facilitate the killing of the enemy.
At the top left we have statistics: life, energy, acquired score, time, and the current round.
The player wins when he has managed to reach the end of the round number without being killed. (10th round)
The game is written in Java programming language.
